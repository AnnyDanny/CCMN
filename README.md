#CCMN

Cisco is the worldwide leader in IT and networking. Cisco helps companies of all sizes
and people to connect, communicate, and collaborate. Many companies have provided
public APIs as a means for others to access their infrastructure. During the realization of
this project, our team can practiced with API and make your own app or program. We must
develop solutions that will use real-time intelligence gathered from the UNIT Factory Wi-Fi
network to enable people and their devices to interact more effectively through real-time
contextual information related to such parameters as locations, availability of users, or
mobile device assets.
In this project, we needed to use the Mobility Services Engine (MSE) APIs to enhance
and personalize your applications by leveraging the capabilities of the different components
of the Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) solution. Business uses CMX and MSE
to send targeted messages, this technology increases customers satisfaction and sales by
offering new revenue models through notification messages and promotional campaigns
focused on people passing by. Also, CMX can help to build heatmap, collect statistics
about your visitors.
